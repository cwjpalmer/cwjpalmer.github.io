  <h1 class="page-title">About</h1>

  <p>I am a cofounder at <a href="http://MinervaFoundry.com">Minerva Foundry</a>, where I work on projects that are sustainable, are transparent, and strive to benefit as many people as possible as much as possible.</p>

  <p>I studied Engineering Chemisty at Queen's University. I have worked in the hydrogen fuel cell and biopharmaceutical industries and done research in nanomaterials, microbiology, and biotechnology. You can read about <a href="http://www.jove.com/video/50069/c-elegans-chemotaxis-assay">some of my work</a> in the Journal of Visualized Experiments.</p>

  <p>I lead the Queen's Fuel Cell Team while it began work on the world's first fuel cell snowmobile and grew from 10 to 60 people to drive this new project forward. I simultaneously lead the Queen's iGEM team, which engineers organisms to perform new functions. I then founded the Queen's Synthetic Biology Organization.</p>

  <p>I love learning new things and following new opportunities. I want to meet <em>you</em>!</p>

  <p>You can find me on twitter, Linkedin, or read my posts on the <a href="http://MinervaFoundry.com/blog">Minerva Founry blog</a></p>
