Hi there!

Thanks for stopping by.

At the moment, I'm blogging exclusively <a href="http://MinervaFoundry.com/blog">at Minerva Foundry</a>. 

Minerva Foundry is a collaborative incubator that I cofounded with <a href="http://twitter.com/jon_amar">Jon Amar</a>. We're working hard to benefit as many people as possible, as much as possible through several projects â€” sustainably and transparently. We're always looking for collaborators and projects. Here's more about <a href="http://MinervaFoundry.com/about">what we're all about</a>.

I'd love to meet you on <a href="http://twitter.com/cwjpalmer">twitter</a> or <a href="http://ca.linkedin.com/in/cwjpalmer">LinkedIn</a>.
